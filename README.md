# Dockerizing simple chatting system 

This is the first assignment  WARM UP:
I have build a simple chatting system using python3 and some dependencies of it using the socket and threading the chatting system is done.
this chatting system consists of a server that handles the connection between the host machine and the clients using the IP address of the host and ports

## What Happens:
the clients are all connected on the same server and when any of them send a message all other clients recieve the same message.
also the server logging have a history of each client connection and dissconnection to it and there IP addresses and Port numbers.

## Implementation:
I have used a static IP address and port number to be used inside the clients and server and then made two files for client and server 
then Implemented them into a docker file with base image of python3 and without any extra addittions, and the image just run the server.py file or client.py
After that I used docker-compose to bulid the two images and connect the server with the clients on the same network and I can from here run multiple client using the same image.

# Running the Files:
to run the chatting system you will need to build the images of server and client images and naming them client:latest and server:latest using 

## Clonning the repo:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/mostafa-metwaly/Distributed_systems_2021.git
 cd Distributed_systems_2021/Assignment1
```
## running the docker-compose image directly 
```bash
docker-compose run client
```

to run the chatting system you will need to build the images of server and client images and naming them client:latest and server:latest using 
## building Dockerfile images
```bash
docker build --pull --rm -f "client/Dockerfile" -t mostafametwaly/client "client" 
docker build --pull --rm -f "server/Dockerfile" -t mostafametwaly/server "server" 
```

## building Docker-comopse image

then you have the images you can then run the dockercompose file to connect both of the images 
```bash
docker-compose -f "docker-compose.yml" up -d --build
```
Another way is to pull the images directly from dockerhub without the need to rebuild them 
And another way is o git clone the hole folder from github directly from the docker-compose file for each image and build and run them directly

## running the chatting system or adding new client
```bash
docker-compose run client
```
## Chatting
After adding new client start writing any message and press enter this message will be prodcasted to all running clients.
```bash
write any message you want and Press Enter
```




### Docker-Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the [list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/#features).

By using the following command you can start up your application:

```
docker-compose -f <docker-compose-file> up
```
